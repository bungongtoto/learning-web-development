  ***A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image
     to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

     You should use the #logo(this is the id of the img element) selector to target the img element.

  ***targeting unordered list in the nav is "nav > ul "
  
  ***You should give the nav > ul elements a justify-content of space-evenly.

The .sr-only text is still visible. There is a common pattern to visually hide text for only screen readers to read.

This pattern is to set the following CSS properties:

position: absolute;
width: 1px;
height: 1px;
padding: 0;
margin: -1px;
overflow: hidden;
clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
white-space: nowrap;
border: 0;
