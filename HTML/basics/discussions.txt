**All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to 
improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example,
 <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
  has an alt attribute with the text A cat.

 **important**
 <!--*we hava from h1 to h6 which varies the importance of a text
            *and only one h1 should be used per page
            *the "p" element is used for paragraphs in html page-->

 **Linking to another page**
 You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, 
 <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'>"here You put the link text"</a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
   ** add target="_blank" so the link to open in another tab

   ** Adding and unOrdered List with the use of (ul)
   **The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.
   * use (li)to create items in the list

   **The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you 
   to associate an image with a caption.Nest the image you just added within a figure element.

   ** use emphasis em element.to emphasis on a text


   ** The "strong" element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.

   ** the form element is used to collect information from user
   The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser 
   that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.

   **
   The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. 
   Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.

   There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the "type" attribute. You can easily create a password field,
    reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.
    Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the type attribute with the value text to the input element.
    - Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.
    - To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the "required" attribute to an input 
    element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element,
     making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

** 
Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> creates a button with the text Click Here.

Add a button element with the text Submit below the input element. The default behavior of clicking a form 
button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.

**You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

** "label" elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes 
it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button.

**The "id" attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.

**If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.


**The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
** The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.
**There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.
**check attribute
    In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

**Language specification
  Add the "lang" attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English.
**important
  All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
**meta element
  You should allow people to use their native language. Tell the browser to encode multiple languages by adding a meta element as a child of the head element. Set its charset attribute to UTF-8.
